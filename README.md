# Food-Reviews---Word2Vec
This project uses natural language processing techniques to build a sentiment analysis model that can accurately classify Amazon food reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. The model is trained on a dataset of Amazon food reviews, and it uses Word2Vec and LSTM to learn the semantic relationships between words in the reviews.

Project Goals:
1. Build a sentiment analysis model that can accurately classify Amazon food reviews.
2. Understand the sentiment of Amazon food reviews, and how it can be used to improve the customer experience.
3. Share the project with the community, and help others to learn about natural language processing.
